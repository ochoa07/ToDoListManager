# To-Do List Manager (C++)

This project is a simple console-based To-Do List Manager written in C++.
It allows users to add, view, mark, and save tasks. The program demonstrates core 
programming concepts like conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and the use of the 
Standard Template Library (STL).
